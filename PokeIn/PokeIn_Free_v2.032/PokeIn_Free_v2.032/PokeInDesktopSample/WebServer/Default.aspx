    This sample solution demonstrates the DesktopClient capabilities of PokeIn Library and consists of two parts.
    First of all, you compile and run WebServer project and see this message. This means, server side PokeIn handlers are registered successfully by the definitions inside Global.asax file.
    You are free to define that listener event on any part of your application and our choice was just for demonstration purposes.
    <br /><br />
    Now, compile and run DesktopClient application and click to the buttons and see the action. 
    We placed some comments inside the code to explain basic key points. If you are already familiar with PokeIn library, as you can see, there is not much difference to connect PokeIn from Desktop like application.
