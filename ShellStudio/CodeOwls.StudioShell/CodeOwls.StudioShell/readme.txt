A few notes about setting up your environment...

You'll need to copy the *testing.addin files to your ~\documents\visualstudio20XX\addins folder.  Edit the file and change the parts that say:

[replace with the path to CodeOwls.StudioShell.dll]

with the full path to the codeowls.studioshell.dll assembly.  Note there are two places in the file you'll need to change.
