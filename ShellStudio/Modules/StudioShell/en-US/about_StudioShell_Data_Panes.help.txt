SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell extends the Visual Studio IDE with simple visualization 
    controls.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	StudioShell adds a Data Panes window to the Visual Studio IDE.  This window 
	contains a collection of grids and charts that have been created from the
	StudioShell environment.
	
	Each data pane is identified by its name, and you can create as many data 
	panes as you need.  
	
	You can create a new data pane using the out-grid or out-chart cmdlet.
	
	For more information, please see the out-grid and out-chart cmdlets.

EXAMPLES

	The code below creates a pie chart showing class size:
	
	ls dte:/solution/codemodel -recurse | `
	  where {$_ -match 'property' -or $_ -match 'method'} | `
	  group {$_.PSParentPath | split-path -leaf} | `
	  out-chart -type pie -x Name -data Count
