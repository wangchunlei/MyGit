    about_StudioShell_Hosts

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell is designed to use used from a variety of suitable hosts.
    This topic outlines the requirements of a suitable host.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	StudioShell is not tightly coupled to its own console.  Instead it is 
	meant to be used from any PowerShell console, allowing you to take
	advantage of the powerfull features in a variety of situations.
	
	Note that the session using StudioShell must have the following properties:
	
	1. the machine on which the session is running has 
		Visual Studio 2008 or 2010, or SSMS 2012 installed.  
	2. the Visual Studio shell has the StudioShell add-in loaded.
	3. the PowerShell host's System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHost 
		implementation supports the IHostSupportsInteractiveSession 
		interface;  specifically, the Runspace property is supported, 
		but the runspace pushing methods and properties are optional.	
	
USING STUDIOSHELL IN OTHER HOSTS (e.g., NuGet, PowerShell.exe)
	Assuming the StudioShell module is in your PSModulePath, you can add 
	StudioShell	features to your session by typing the following:
	
		import-module StudioShell
		
	Several StudioShell features are enabled by default in the 
	StudioShell	host, but are disabled by default in other hosts.  For
