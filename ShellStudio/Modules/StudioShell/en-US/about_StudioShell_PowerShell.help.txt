    about_StudioShell_PowerShell

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell is designed to use used from a variety of suitable hosts.
    This topic describes how to use StudioShell features from the standard
	PowerShell console.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Assuming the StudioShell module is in your PSModulePath, you can add 
	StudioShell	features to your PowerShell session by typing the following:
	
		import-module StudioShell
		
	This will load the StudioShell PSDTE provider and create the DTE: drive
	in your PowerShell session.
		
	Several StudioShell features are enabled by default in the 
	StudioShell	host, but are disabled by default in the standard PowerShell 
	host.
	
  LOADING PROFILES
	The StudioShell host user profile script is NOT loaded when the StudioShell
	module is imported directly.  
	
	In non-default hosts this profile script must be executed explicitly by 
	dot-sourcing the profile script:
	
		pushd $env:HOMEDRIVE
		. ~/CodeOwlsLLC.StudioShell/profile.ps1
		popd
	
  USING SOLUTION MODULES
	Solution modules are not automatically loaded and unloaded when using the 
	StudioShell module in other hosts.  
	
	To enable this feature,	you can run the following script after importing 
	the StudioShell module:
	
		. ( get-module StudioShell | `
			select -expand ModuleBase | `
			join-path -child '..\InitializationScripts\register-solutionevents.ps1' )

SPECIAL NOTES FOR POWERSHELL USERS
  VISUAL STUDIO INSTANCE
	When used from the PowerShell host, a hidden instance of Visual Studio is 
	created and manipulated by the StudioShell module.  This Visual Studio
	instance is closed automatically when the StudioShell module is removed from
	the PowerShell session (or when the session itself ends).

	If the hidden Visual Studio instance is closed by some means outside of the
	StudioShell module unloading (e.g., though task manager or using 
	PowerShell), any attempt to use the StudioShell module from the session 
	will raise an error.

	At this time is it not possible to use StudioShell from a PowerShell 
	console to drive SQL Server Management Studio.

  VISUALIZATION CMDLETS
	When used from the PowerShell host, the data visualization cmdlets (e.g.,
	out-grid and out-chart) will raise an error.
