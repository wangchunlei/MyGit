    about_StudioShell_SSMS

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell is designed to use used from a variety of suitable hosts.
    This topic describes how to use StudioShell features from SQL Server
	Management Studio 2012 (SSMS).

LONG DESCRIPTION
	SSMS integration is only available if you installed StudioShell using
	the MSI installer and selected the SSMS Integration feature.

	Once installed, the StudioShell console is available in SSMS from the 
	View menu.

	The StudioShell host in SSMS is identical is nearly all respects to the 
	host in Visual Studio.  They share the same profile scripts, feature
	sets, and path topologies.

  	SSMS support is experimental at the moment.  Moreover, several key path 
	nodes are not supported by the SSMS object model and are therefore not 
	available on the DTE drive: 

	* the project hive cannot be manipulated because the SSMS object model
	  does not support it.

	* there is no code model implemented for T-SQL, and therefore there are
	  no code model hives in the DTE drive in SSMS.

	* it is very likely that other portions of the DTE drive are 
	  non-functional or unstable.
		  
	You have been warned, use with _extreme caution_.
