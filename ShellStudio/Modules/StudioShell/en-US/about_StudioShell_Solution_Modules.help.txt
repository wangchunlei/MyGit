    about_StudioShell_Solution_Modules

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    StudioShell imports specific modules when a solution is loaded.  The
    modules are removed when the solution is closed.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Solution Modules provide an easy way to save StudioShell customizations
	with a particular solution.  For instance, if a solution uses the psake
	module to control its build process, the solution module could update
	the Visual Studio UI to invoke psake instead of MSBuild when any of the
	build commands are executed.
	
	A solution module can be a script module (.psm1 file) or module definition
	(.psd1 file) that:
	
	1. resides in the same directory as the solution (.sln) file.
	2. has the same name as the solution file, except for the extension.
	
	For example, if a solution file exists at:
	
		c:\code\mysolution.sln
		
	the solution module would be found at:
	
		c:\code\mysolution.psm1
		or
		c:\code\mysolution.psd1
		
	Solution modules are automatically imported after the solution is opened,
	and they are automatically removed as the solution is closed.  However, 
	you can override this behavior by modifying the StudioShell settings.
	
	
	Running Scripts on Module Unload
	--------------------------------
	While it is possible to attach code to the OnRemove event for a solution
	module, the syntax is cumbersome:
	
	$MyInvocation.MyCommand.ScriptBlock.Module.OnRemove = {
		# ...		
		write-host 'solution module has been unloaded'
	}
	
	Frankly, the author has to Google how to do this every time he needs to 
	use this feature, so a shortcut was added.  If your module exposes a
	function named:
	
	unregister-<ModuleName>
	
	It will be invoked automatically during the module unload process.
	
	For example, if your solution is named 'MongoProvider' then your solution
	module unregister function would be named:
	
	unregister-MongoProvider
	
	The function will be invoked with no parameters.  Below is an example of 
	a complete unregister function for a solution module named 'MySolution'.
	
	function unregister-MySolution
	{
		write-host 'solution module has been unloaded'
	}
	
	
NOTES
	Solution modules are only imported when your console is open.  If you 
	open the console after the solution is loaded in the IDE, the solution 
	module will be imported immediately after StudioShell is initialized.
	
	Solution modules are enabled by default in the standard StudioShell host.
	If you import the solution module in another host, such as NuGet or
	PowerShell.exe, you will need to enable this feature manually.  You
	can do this with the following script:
	
	. ( get-module StudioShell | `
		select -expand Path | `
		split-path -parent | `
		join-path -child '..\InitializationScripts\register-solutionevents.ps1' )
