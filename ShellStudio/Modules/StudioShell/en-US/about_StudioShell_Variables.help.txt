LONG DESCRIPTION
	StudioShell defines several automatic variables that track various states
    of the Visual Studio IDE.  These variables provide useful shortcuts to 
    accessing common IDE components that change frequently.
    
  General
  
	$dte : the root EnvDTE.DTE object exposed by Visual Studio
	$psUnsupportedConsoleApplications : a list of applications the StudioShell console is prohibited to run
	
  Current Selections

	$activeWindow : the window in which the user is currently working.  Note
					that when this variable is accessed from the console,
					the value will always be the console window; however, when
					this variable is accessed in a script that is responding to
					an IDE command (such as a menu item), the value will be
					whatever window currently has input focus.
					
	$selectedProjectItems : the list of selected project items from the
							Solution Explorer window.
							
	$selectedProjects : the list of selected projects from the Solution
						Explorer window.
	
	$selectedNamespace : the namespace code model element that contains the 
						current insertion point.

	$selectedClass : the class code model element that contains the current
						insertion point.
						
	$selectedMethod : the method code model element that contains the current
						insertion point.
						
	$selectedProperty : the property code model element that contains the 
						current insertion point.
					
  Debugger 
  		
	$currentDebugMode : identifies the current mode of the integrated debugger.
	
	$currentProcess : the process currently being debugged.
	
	$currentThread : the thread currently active in the debugger.
	
	$currentStackFrame : the current stack frame.
	
  IDE Events
    
	$buildEvents : the EnvDTE.BuildEvents interface exposing build events.
    
    $debuggerEvents : the EnvDTE.DebuggerEvents interface exposing various 
						debugger events.
						
	$debuggerProcessEvents : the EnvDTE.DebuggerProcessEvents interface 
								exposing a process state change event.
						
	$debuggerExpressionEvaluationEvents : the interface exposing an event
											raised when a debugger expression
											is undergoing evaluation.
											
	$dteEvents : the EnvDTE.DTEEvents interface exposing environment state
					events.
					
	$findEvents : the EnvDTE.FindEvents interface exposing events raised 
					during find operations.
					
	$miscFilesEvents : the EnvDTE.ProjectItemsEvents interface exposing events
						raised during the management of "miscellaneous" 
                        solution files.
                           
	$publishEvents : the EnvDTE.PublishEvents interface exposing events raised
						during the publish task.

	$solutionEvents : the EnvDTE.SolutionEvents interface that exposes solution
						events, such as solution opening and closing.
						
	$solutionItemsEvents : the EnvDTE.ProjectItemsEvents interface exposing
							events raised during the management of solution-
							level items.
						
	$projectEvents : the EnvDTE.ProjectsEvents interface exposing project 
						events, such as adding or removing projects.
						
	$projectItemEvents : the EnvDTE.ProjectItemsEvents interface exposing 
							project item events, such as adding or 
							removing project items.
                           
    $selectionEvents : the EnvDTE.SelectionEvents interface exposing an event
						raised when the current selection is changed.
